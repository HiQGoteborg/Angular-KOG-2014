With her husband Homer, she has three children: Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. Marge is the moralistic force in her family and often provides a grounding voice in the midst of her family's antics by trying to maintain order in the Simpson household. She is often portrayed as a stereotypical television mother and is often included on lists of top \"TV moms\". She has appeared in other media relating to The Simpsons—including video games, The Simpsons Movie, The Simpsons Ride, commercials, and comic books—and inspired an entire line of merchandise."},

	{"id": 3, "firstName": "Bart", "lastName": "Simpson", "role": "Son", "likes": ["pranks"], "dislikes": ["school"], "imageUrl": "/images/bart.png", "description": "At ten years old, Bart is the eldest child and only son of Homer and Marge, and the brother of Lisa and Maggie. His birth date is February 23, but the year is ambiguous as he is perpetually ten years old. Bart's most prominent character traits are his mischievousness, rebelliousness and disrespect for authority. He has appeared in other media relating to The Simpsons, including video games, The Simpsons Movie, The Simpsons Ride, commercials, and comic books; he has also inspired an entire line of merchandise. In casting, Nancy Cartwright originally planned to audition for the role of Lisa, while Yeardley Smith tried out for Bart. Smith's voice was too high for a boy, so she was given the role of Lisa. Cartwright found that Lisa was not interesting at the time, so instead auditioned for Bart, which she thought was a better role. Hallmarks of the character include his chalkboard gags in the opening sequence; his prank calls to Moe; and his catchphrases \"Eat my shorts\", \"¡Ay, caramba!\", and \"Don't have a cow, man!\""}
